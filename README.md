# Core Electronics Unified PiicoDev Library
*Un-Unifies the I2C drivers for different implementations of MicroPython*

This fork is designed to only run on 'Machine' based systems eg ESP32, ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi Picos's 
Specifically this fork has been minified to reduce memory (ram) impact on the memory (ram) starved ESP8266
